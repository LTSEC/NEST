## What is it?
NEST is an all-in-one solution to competition and CTF scoring. NEST aims to provide a simple setup of your own competition or CTF, complete with a fully functioning frontend that allows for quick design and creation of custom or prebuilt games. NEST also has a built in comprehensive IAM system to allow for customization of privileges for groups which can be assigned to users. NEST also aims to make creating new CTFs and games easy, with built in integration for developers to create, test, and submit their own games, services, or CTFs.
